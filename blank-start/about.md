## About Us
Founded in 1993, Greene Garden has served as an event venue and green space for the Fort Greene community for over 30 years. As a part of the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust, our garden is protected from purchase and included in a larger system of community gardens in the city.

Greene Garden is more than just a green space: it's a center for community and culture. This community comes together a few times a month to host events on our beautiful stage!

In the fall and the summer we host internships where New York City youth collaborate to better the garden. Previously, interns have knitted sweaters for trees, built furniture for the garden, and conducted their own science experiments.
